# B-spline Transition Models

Code for "Flexible Modeling of Transition Processes with B-Splines", Susmann & Alkema (Forthcoming).

To run the main models:
```
library(targets)
tar_make()
```

Or to run the main models in parallel:
```
library(targets)
tar_make_future()
```

Code to generate plots and tables can be found in the `R` folder.
